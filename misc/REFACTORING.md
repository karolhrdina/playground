# 42ity Current Refactoring Task

## What is this non-sense?

Out team had the fortune to participate in a very good, no-bulsshit, Scrum
training.  We learned that once certain amount of points is established for any
given sprint, you don't add new tasks (points) to the sprint. Rather than that
this time should be spent working on any of the following things:

* work on new user stories (preparation; technical, bussines related
discussions; specifications etc...) 
* overhead 
* technical debt

This "document" is about the last bullet point - technical debt. 

Here we'll maintain information about the current refactoring task we'd like to
undergo, if such writeup is needed.

## Process

Due to our experience with bad actors we want to make it absolutely clear how
this is going to work. 

1. Each sprint the whole team, through a magical process called voting, will
decide what is the next priority regarding techical debt. 
2. It will be **one** topic, not two.
3. This topic will be written on the whiteboard. The rest of the ideas are wiped.
4. At least title is update in this document.
5. Optionally, if it's needed, use this document to write down information
about the task (design, etc..).
6. In the rare case when the topic has just been fixed and there is still
reasonably enough time until the end of sprint, this process is repeated.

## Current Topic: Get rid of agent-autoconfig

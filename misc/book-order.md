We are going to suggest ordering some books.
Please add your suggestions.

* [Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Games-People-Play-Psychology-Relationships/dp/0141040270) by John Cleese, recommended by Deborah Appleby, our customer relationship trainer.

* [The Psychology of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Computer-Programming-Silver-Anniversary/dp/0932633420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) by Gerald M. Weinberg. Deals in depth with some topics which were only briefly mentioned during our SCRUM training. I think it would help us to derive more value from using SCRUM.

* [Visualise, document and explore your software architecture](https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture)

* [Freshman Murders](https://leanpub.com/freshmanmurders)

* [Peopleware:Productive Projects and Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) by Tom DeMarco. Classics of software project management. According to reviews, it's still releveant even decades later.

* [Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380)

* [The Atomic Chef](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Chef-Other-Design-Technology/dp/0963617869) , since we should learn from mistakes other people made (especially when it comes to safety).

* [The Art of Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Chef-Other-Design-Technology/dp/0963617869)

# Book Wishlist 

We are going to suggest ordering some books.
Please add your suggestions.

* [Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Games-People-Play-Psychology-Relationships/dp/0141040270) by John Cleese, recommended by Deborah Appleby, our customer relationship trainer.

* [The Psychology of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Computer-Programming-Silver-Anniversary/dp/0932633420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) by Gerald M. Weinberg. Deals in depth with some topics which were only briefly mentioned during our SCRUM training. I think it would help us to derive more value from using SCRUM.
